# Jibo_Interview
## A fun way to practice one of the most stressful events I know (Job Interviews)
### [MLH Prime Southwest Regional November 2016](https://prime.mlh.io/events/southwest-regional/)

Jibo_Interview is a skill for the [jibo robot](https://www.jibo.com) that enables the user to prompt a mock interview by simply saying "Hey, Jibo". Jibo will then lead the user through a number of interview questions to help them prepare.

Hopefully this will help them be more relaxed in their actual interview enabling them to be more successful and give them a better shot at earning the job!

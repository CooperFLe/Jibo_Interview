### A fun way to practice one of the most stressful events I know (Job Interviews)
MLH Prime Southwest Regional November 2016

Jibo_Interview is a skill for the jibo robot that enables the user to prompt a mock interview by simply saying "Hey, Jibo". Jibo will then lead the user through a number of interview questions to help them prepare.

Hopefully this will help them be more relaxed in their actual interview enabling them to be more successful and give them a better shot at earning the job!
